# 🧠 FocusFlow – AI-Powered Chrome Extension for ADHD Support

**FocusFlow** is a smart Chrome extension designed to help users—especially those with ADHD—stay focused while browsing the web. It uses gaze tracking, inactivity detection, and creative re-engagement techniques to gently bring the user back when focus is lost.

---

## 🎯 What It Does

- 📸 **Calibrates Camera Position**  
  Upon activation, the extension opens a calibration page to help the user adjust their webcam position for accurate gaze tracking. It also clearly communicates camera usage and requests permission.

- 🔍 **Detects Inactivity**  
  After calibration, the extension monitors user activity (cursor movement, scrolling, clicks). If no activity is detected for a certain duration (e.g. 1 minute), gaze detection is triggered.

- 👀 **Analyzes Gaze Focus**  
  Using the GazeTracking library, it checks if the user is visually focused on the screen.

- 🔔 **Re-engagement Strategies**  
  If the user is distracted, FocusFlow gently re-engages them using:
  - Popups with puzzles, jokes, or exercise prompts
  - Audio feedback ("Hey, wake up!") or reading aloud the last hovered content
  - Encouraging creativity and interaction

- ✍️ **Tools Tab for Notes**  
  Includes a drawing and annotation tab with tools for:
  - Highlighting content
  - Writing quick notes on the page
  - Saving session content (until the page is refreshed)

## 🧭 How It Works

1. **User opens the extension** → Calibration page is shown
2. **User adjusts webcam** → Gaze tracking is aligned and permission is granted
3. **System summarizes page** → Summary is generated and ready for playback
4. **Inactivity Timer** starts → If no activity for 1 minute:
   - Gaze is analyzed
   - If distracted → show prompt / read aloud / pop-up
5. **Tools Tab** always available → User can annotate or highlight live on the page

### ✅ Backend Checklist

- ✔️ **FastSpeech2** must be set up and ready to infer audio from text  
- ✔️ **Flask** runs a `/speak` endpoint that returns WAV audio as a stream (in-memory)  
- ✔️ **GazeTracking** runs locally and processes camera frames sent from the extension
